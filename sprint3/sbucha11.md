Group: The Karen Index

## What I planned to do
- Reorganize how reviews are parsed from the webscraper #34
- Allow scoring function to be called by web scraper #33
- Send scores back to the storage system to be displayed on the leaderboard #26

## What I did not do
I did everything I set out to do during this sprint

## Problems I encountered
I encountered quite a few problems with Python package compatibility among my team's different machines. 
This required a lot of fiddling with pip install and updating my computer's settings and resulted in a bit
of difficulty when trying to test how my code works with the rest of my team's work.

## What I accomplished
- Updated the structure of file_analysis.py to be class oriented, which allows other files to call the analyze function when necessary.
- Added words to detect the possibility of a scam
- Updated how review scores are stored so that the storage system can retrieve them and have them easily available for display 

## Issues I worked on
- Reorganize how reviews are parsed from the webscraper #34
- Allow scoring function to be called by web scraper #33
- Send scores back to the storage system to be displayed on the leaderboard #26

## Files I worked on 
- file_analysis.py
- word_library.py
