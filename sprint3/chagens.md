# Sprint 2
Caleb Hagens
Github id: Chagens
Group: The Karen Index

## What I planned to do
- if webscraper allows use data for leaderboards #40
- update leaderboard to match other UI display #37
- Work with prototype data for leaderboards #36

## What I did not do
I did everything I set out to do during this sprint, except for issue #40
we as a group ran into issues with the text recieved back from the webscraper since
it was a tuple of tuples that removed new line characters so did not add it to leaderboards due 
to how it looked when displayed

## Problems I encountered
As mentioned earlier huge problem with the actually data recieved back from the webscraper
it being a tuple of tuples was weird, but once we figured out where the actual
text we wanted was we had the issue of that text not having newline characters. So
it extended the length of the screen to match the amount of characters needed
to be displayed. For the most part everything is done for the project at this point.

## What I accomplished
- Updated the leaderboard to match the UI display of main window
- Added prototype data to the leaderboard


## Issues I worked on
- if webscraper allows use data for leaderboards #40
- update leaderboard to match other UI display #37
- Work with prototype data for leaderboards #36

## Files I worked on
