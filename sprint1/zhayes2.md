What you planned to do:
 * I planned on setting up a format file for our .json storage, issue #15.
 * I planned on creating a program to create the storage and start being able to store said data, issue #14.
 * I planned on beginning to implement the leaderboard feature, issue #9.

What you did not do:
 * I didn't get issue #9 done. It turned out to require much more interconnectivity and planning than what had been accomplished at the time. In addition, I also had a lack of time and barely got the other work done.

What problems you encountered:
 * My main problem was that of finding time to work on the project. Whether that was due to my own scheduling of my time or due to sheer workload, I'll find out in greater detail this upcoming spring now that I know better what to expect

What you accomplished.
 * I added the format.json file that we will use as a general guide as we flesh out the way we will store our information - this corresponds to issue #15.
 * I also added the storing.py file. This contains the beginnings of our storage functionality that will create the TKI.json file that will hold our data as it is being run. At the moment it just dumps some test data in, but it too will serve as a guid in the future. At the moment, we only needed it to perform basic functionality so that it can be more easily "hooked-up" to the other pieces of the program. After more interconnectivity of the pieces, it will be expanded on.
