What I planned to do:
- Create search bar (issue #3)
- Create category toggles (issue #8)
- Create leaderboard display (issue #6)

What I did not do:
- All issues completed for the sprint

What problems I encountered:
-Installing pyqt turned out to be a issues as the python version I had did not come with pip, and the visual
studio version I had was also incorrect.
-Learning the syntax of a new language like python and beggining to implement in it.

What I accomplished:
I fully implemented a search bar that you can enter a text field into, a button that will display future
leaderboard data, and a category dropdown toggle. This was all done using pyqt6 to display to the user.
No major issues where encountered over the course of the sprint. Files worked on include main_ui.py and Main_window.py.
