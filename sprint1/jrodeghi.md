What I planned to do:
- Write a web scrapper that got the html from a website(issue #2)
- parse the html using beautiful soup to get the amazon reviews (issue #4)
- research how to get google and yelp reviews(issue #7)

What I did not do:
- I completed all my issues this sprint.

What problems I encountered:
- Syntax nuances with Python, getting used to something other than C++ 
- Understanding the Beautiful soup documentation
- Not haveing the best knowledge of how html works

What I accomplished:
I used Beaytiful soup and requests to get the html of a website, In this case an amazon item, from
there I parsed out the reviews so that they can be analyzed and stored. For issue 2 I put a mention in a comment on the commit 
and for issue seven I wrote a comment on the issue about what I did.
