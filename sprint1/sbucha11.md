What I planned to do:
- Create dictionaries for language analysis (issue #11).
- Create a completed list of categories (issue #8).
- Create language analysis functions in python (#issue #1).

What I did not do:
- I completed all my issues this sprint.

What problems I encountered:
- Setup issues with my PC, not having git installed, etc.
- Syntax nuances with Python, getting used to something other than C++.
- Coming up with efficient ways to analyze a string and researching what words to search for/emphasize.

What I accomplished:
I added a program that analyzes an example review, searches through that review to find matches to list
of predefined "angry" words, and scores that review based on how many matched angry words it finds, the 
number of words that are all caps, and the length of the review. This covered issues #1, #8, and #11 
with the file file_analysis.py.
