## What I planned to do
- #28 remove search from favorites
- #29 make background not plain white
- #30 display scraped comment in the app
- #31 make layout less horizontal
- #32 add a search button

## What I did not do
- display the actual comment (since the scraper is not working)

The group had a collective issue with getting the scaper to work which impede my progress in getting the comment to show on the app. though there is now a place for it in the UI

- #31 make layout less horizontal
- #32 add a search button
