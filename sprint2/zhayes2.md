### What you planned to do
* #22 : Create a connected pipeline of data from the web-scraper intake to the .json file
* #25 : Create a function to draw the information out of the .json file
* #9 : Create a function to hold the data for the leaderboard seperately from the rest of the memory

### What you did not do
* #25 : Create a function to draw the information out of the .json file (Was almost finished)
* #9 : Create a function to hold the data for the leaderboard seperately from the rest of the memory

### What problems you encountered
* The Web Scraper went down, so I had no real data to test, so testing/implementation was slower than anticipated
* The leaderboard required further struture to be supported, so it was put off yet again

### What you accomplished
* The pipeline was theoretically established from the web scraper to the analysis to my storage.
* Reviews can now be stored onto a local .json file
* During runtime, a custom object holds the active memory for editing and usage, and on shutdown, the memory is stored into the .json file
* .json file format was revamped to better reflect our actual data being taken in

### Issues you worked on
* #25
* #22
* #9

### Files you worked on
* storing.py
* format.json
