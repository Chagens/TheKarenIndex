Group: The Karen Index

## What I planned to do
- Send scores back to the storage system to be displayed in the leaderboard #26
- Create functions to score the other categories #27
- Expand the dictionary of words with which to analyze each review #24
- Retrieve reviews from web scraper to analyze #20

## What I did not do
- Send scores back to the storage system to be displayed in the leaderboard

## Problems I encountered
The group had a collective hang-up when Amazon flagged the web scraper as a bot and refused to
allow us to continue retrieving the data we need. We were able to make progress using simulated 
data and we connected the different aspects of our project together, but full testing was halted
until we're able to find a workable solution to the web scraper.

## What I accomplished
- Added more than 5000 words to detect anger in reviews
- Added scoring functionality for every other category including length, amount of misspells, and likeliness of scams
- Added spell checker to be able to detect misspelled words
- Added communication between the web scraper and the language analysis program

## Issues I worked on
- Send scores back to the storage system to be displayed in the leaderboard #26
- Create functions to score the other categories #27
- Expand the dictionary of words with which to analyze each review #24
- Retrieve reviews from web scraper to analyze #20

## Files I worked on 
- file_analysis.py
- word_library.py
