# Sprint 2
Caleb Hagens
Github id: Chagens
Group: The Karen Index

## What I planned to do
- Get scores from the storage system to be displayed in the leaderboard #21
- Create logo to be used for the program launch and all media associated with software #23
- Connect webscraper to search bar #19


## What I did not do
- Get scores from the storage system to be displayed in leaderboard

## Problems I encountered
The group had a collective hang-up when Amazon flagged the web scraper as a bot and refused to
allow us to continue retrieving the data we need. This posed a significant issue for me as for a large chunk
of my work was to be taking that displayed information and putting it on the leaderboard window

## What I accomplished
- added window for the additional leadrboard information
- Added connection to the webscraper creating the call in main window
- Created logo in gimp then added the needed lines for the display in python program


## Issues I worked on
- Connect the web scraper to the search bar #19
- Display leaderboard # 21
- Create Logo #23


## Files I worked on 
- Main_Window.py
