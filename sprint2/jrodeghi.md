## What I planned to do
- get the star count for the amazon reviews
- put the reviews in to the storage system
- cut out the reviews that dont match the star count we want

## What I did not do
- I wrote the code for all three things but amazon has not let me get reviews so I do not know if it works
- I did not put the reviews into the storage system as the path of the data changed

## Problems I encountered
- The problem that I enocuntered was amazon blocking the webscrapper. This caused the rest of the group to have to use simulated data.

## What I accomplished
- I wrote the code to get the stars
- I wrote the code to sort through the reviews for the correct stars

## Issues I worked on
- Get the star count of the review #16
- cut out the reviews that do not fall in desired stars #17
- Send the data to the storage system #17

## Files I worked on 
- reviewscraper.py
