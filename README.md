## Description
There is a lot of untapped comedy potential in angry reviews. Rather than scrolling through 1-star reviews in hopes of finding some that happen to be preposterously angry/incomprehensible/otherwise entertaining, our project allows you to enter an Amazon product and find the highest rated reviews of the desired category and present them in a way that filters out all of the boring/reasonable/otherwise helpful reviews.

## How to Install and Run
This project runs on Python VERSION and requires pip installing the following libraries:
* spellchecker
* re
* PyQt6
* selenium

## How to Use
Once the program is running, simply enter a link to an Amazon product in the text box, select a category, and the program will return the top rated reviews in the chosen category.
